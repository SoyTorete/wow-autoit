A small collection of AutoIT gadgets for use with the World of Warcraft, of
course if you are suspended or loose your account through the use of any
automation tools please don't blame me :P

Naturally, to compile, run and use these tools, you will need to install
AutoIT (http://www.autoitscript.com/site/autoit/)
