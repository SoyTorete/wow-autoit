A simple auto-clicker bot originally used to interact with Darkmoon Faire NPC's

When it starts it will sample two mouse locations (you have to hover the mouse
over each of the two NPC's in the DMF stall).  It will then repeatedly click
and interact with them.  Use an auto-buying add-on to buy the items you want
from these vendors.
